        <head>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</head>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height</l>
          <l>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight</l>
          <l>For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>I love thee to the level of everyday's</l>
          <l>Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.</l>
          <l>I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;</l>
          <l>I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>I love thee with a passion put to use</l>
          <l>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.</l>
          <l>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose</l>
          <l>With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,</l>
          <l>Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,</l>
          <l>I shall but love thee better after death.</l>
