 How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 
 I love thee to the depth and breadth and height 
 My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight 
 For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. 
 
 I love thee to the level of everyday's 
 Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. 
 I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; 
 I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. 
 
 I love thee with a passion put to use 
 In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. 
 I love thee with a love I seemed to lose 
 With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath, 
 Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose, 
 I shall but love thee better after death.
