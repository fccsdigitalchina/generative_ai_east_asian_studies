I saw a piece of calligraphy in the CBDB office (1737 Cambridge Street, K304, MA, 02138, USA). The author is Jianguo, but I don't know Jianguo's full name. The time information that Jianguo left for this work is the New Year of 壬辰. The content of the calligraphy is: 哈佛大學CGA惠存。天下為公。中地數碼集團贈。壬辰新春建國書. The seals are: 眾緣, 中原人民, 建國印信. I want to cite it in my dissertation. Based on the Chicago Manual of Style, how can I cite it?
