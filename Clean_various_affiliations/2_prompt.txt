You are given a list of affiliations of participants of a workshop. The list contains some duplicate affiliations and some variations in the way that the same affiliation is written. Your task is to clean the list and generate a table of the cleaned affiliations and their frequencies. 
Cleaned affiliations should be uniform and consistent, and should represent the same organization or department even if they have been written in different ways. For example, “Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations”, “East Asian Language and Civilization”, and “Dep of East Asian Languages and Civilizations” should all be treated as the same affiliation.
Your output should be a table with two columns: the first column should contain the cleaned affiliations, and the second column should contain the frequency of each affiliation in the original list.
