I have three columns of data in 1_task_correlation.csv

fff_ro	ff_ro	f_ro
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0
...

The total records are 14116.
1. 78 records in fff_ro are 1, others are 0.
2. 68 records in ff_ro are 1, others are 0.
3. 224 records in f_ro are 1, others are 0.
If I want to calculate the correlation and correlation significance between each of the pairs of fff_ro, ff_ro and f_ro, and print the result. How can I do it in R?
