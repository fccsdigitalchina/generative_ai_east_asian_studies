Here is CBDB API:
https://cbdb.fas.harvard.edu/cbdbapi/person.php?id={personid}&o=json

I have a list of personid
89
170
340
400
622
624
646
647
935
936
937
1474
1692
2043
1285
1286
1288

please write python codes to query CBDB APIs by these personids separately.

Please find the Address node(Package-PersonAuthority-PersonInfo-Person-PersonAddresses-Address) that AddrType: "籍貫(基本地址)", get the corresponding AddrName.
The Address node in the CBDB API response might contains a single address element, in which case it is represented as a dictionary, but it might also contains multiple address elements, it is represented as a list of dictionaries.
Put all the personid and AddrName together, and print it as
personid    AddrName
Query interval is 0.5s
