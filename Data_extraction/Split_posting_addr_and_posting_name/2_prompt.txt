Rewrite the following posting information into **posting address** and **official titles**, with the following output columns:

1. **original_text**: The original posting information.
2. **posting_address_name_lower**: The first (or lower) geographical or administrative location in the address.
3. **posting_address_name_upper**: The second (or upper) geographical or administrative location in the address, if it exists.
4. **posting_office_name**: The formal official title related to the post. If abbreviations or informal names are used, convert them to formal titles. Don't put any address information here. Move any address information to posting_address_name_lower or posting_address_name_upper, and rewrite the rest of it to a formal official name.

### Split Rule:
- If the address contains multiple locations, split the first location into **posting_address_name_low** and the second location into **posting_address_name_upper**.
- If there is only one location, place it in **posting_address_name_low** and leave **posting_address_name_upper** blank.
- Do not run any program to extract the information. Only output the table in the final result
  
#### Reason for the Split:
- **Lower** refers to the first mentioned address, and **upper** refers to any second or subsequent address mentioned in the original text. This ensures clear differentiation when multiple addresses are provided, without implying any specific administrative hierarchy.

Use this rule to split the addresses and extract the **official title** accurately.
