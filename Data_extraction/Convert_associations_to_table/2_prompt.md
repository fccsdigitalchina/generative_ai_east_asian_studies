Take the following text and extract relationships into a structured tab-separated table with three columns:  

1. **Person1** (Include all information about Person1)  
2. **Relationship** (Only the kinship term)  
3. **Person2** (Include all information about Person2)  

**Important Relationship Logic:**  
- The relationship must always follow this structure:  
  **Person1's [relationship] is Person2.**  
- The **Relationship** column should only contain the kinship term

**Output Format:**  
- The output **must be strictly tab-separated (\t)**.  
- **Do not generate anything else** except for the tab-separated table.
